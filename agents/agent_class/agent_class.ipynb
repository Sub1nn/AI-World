      "Where to start? I'm Chef Subin, a line-cook turned pastry-apprentice turned pop-up chef, and I've had the privilege of cooking on five continents. Every dish I plate carries a backstory, and at least one scar – some on my hands, some on my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "My culinary journey began in the kitchens of New York City, where I worked my way up from dishwasher to garde-manger in a classic diner. That's where I earned my first scar, a nasty cut from a 400°F sheet pan during a Super Bowl Sunday rush. From there, I traveled to Lima, Peru, where I mastered the art of slicing corvina in 7-second bursts before citrus cures at a bustling cevichería.\n",
      "\n",
      "The call of adventure took me to Patagonia, where I cooked lamb asado on fallen lenga-wood for 150 trekkers a night. I earned another scar, a triangular pit on my left thumb, when a hot rock shard lodged itself during a particularly intense cooking session.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I found myself in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where I honed my skills as a line cook in the city's famous hawker stalls. I learned to wield a wok like a pro, mastering the art of wok hei over 600°F open burners. That's also where I got an oil splash scar on my arm at 3 a.m. in a Tokyo alley.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, I decided to trade in my wok for a pastry brush, and I began a pastry apprenticeship at the renowned Pierre Hermé in Paris. I laminated over 10,000 croissants, and, yes, earned another scar – a 220°C deck oven rack burn on my left forearm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, I'm based in Riihimäki, Finland, where I'm running my own pop-up series, \"Taste Trek,\" which has been selling out in 72 hours. I've got a newsletter, \"Scars & Spatulas,\" where I share weekly stories and recipes, and I'm always looking for new collaborations and projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's me in a nutshell – or rather, a perfectly laminated croissant.\n"

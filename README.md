## 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone & enter
git clone https://github.com/Sub1nn/AI-World
cd AI-World

# 2. One-line environment
make setup          # creates conda env + installs deps

# 3. Fire up the first app
streamlit run exercises/bmi_calculator.py
```

> **That’s it!** Your browser opens a live BMI calculator built with Streamlit—our “Hello World” to ML engineering.
